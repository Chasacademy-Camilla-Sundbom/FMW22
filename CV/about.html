					<h2>About:</h2>
					<p>
						If you are looking for a committed employee with a large work
						capacity, I am the right person. It is easy for me to embrace new
						tasks and methods. It is important for me to develop and develop as
						an employee. My strong sense of order and structured way of working
						means that I perform well, even when quick action and quick
						decisions are required. I enjoy working towards common goals where
						each individual colleague's effort and ability to communicate is
						necessary to be able to solve the task as a team and achieve good
						results. I look forward to introducing myself more closely at a
						personal meeting.
					</p>

					<h2>Summary:</h2>
					<p>
						Here you have a strong employee who is ready to take on a new
						challenge. I am hereby applying for a job with you as I see you as
						my next challenge. I choose to see solutions in both my work and
						personal life, not problems. After my 15 years in service, I think a
						position with you would suit me perfectly.
